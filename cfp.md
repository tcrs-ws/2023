### Guidelines from the ACM
By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. For more information, visit [acm.org](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.

The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
