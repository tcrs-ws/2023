We are pleased to share that the first edition of TCRS will be kicked off with a keynote by Jonathan Sprinkle from Vanderbilt University. His talk, titled "Safety First: Though on the Other Hand, Time is Critical," describes the deployment of research-quality software and hardware for open-road driving experiments by fleets of vehicles. He will discuss approaches for co-design of a research testbed for societal-scale systems and all the practical difficulties that come with that.
